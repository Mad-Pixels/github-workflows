## Concept

### The Problem
Modern teams often face a gap between local development and CI/CD environments.  
Scripts and tooling are scattered, environments drift, and debugging CI becomes a trial-and-error nightmare.

### Core Philosophy: Taskfile-Centric Development
We define all developer-facing tasks in `Taskfile.yml` ([taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)), making it the **single source of truth** for every operation:
- 🟢 `Consistent across environments` — same commands work locally and in CI
- 🐳 `Containerized by default` — all tasks run securely in isolated Docker containers
- 🔧 `Empowers developers` — no hidden magic, all tools and commands are transparent and reproducible

### Secure Container Execution
Each task runs in a hardened, ephemeral container:
- 🔒 `Security-first` — dropped capabilities, non-root users, read-only mounts
- 📦 `Explicit tooling` — versions are locked (e.g. Node 23, Terraform 1.8.5)
- 🔁 `Unified interface` — all orchestration handled by a single internal `_docker/run` task

### GitOps-Driven by Design
This approach follows GitOps principles:
- ✍️ `Declarative` — all tasks defined and version-controlled in Git
- 🔁 `Reproducible` — identical environments at every run
- 🕵️‍♂️ `Auditable` — clear separation between dev and deploy operations

### Local-to-CI Reproducibility
If it works locally, it works in CI — **guaranteed**:
- Developers run `task build`, `task lint`, or `task type-check` inside Docker
- CI invokes the exact same tasks via the `taskfile-runner` GitHub Action
- No CI-specific scripts or hidden steps
- Debugging happens locally, not through failed pipelines

### Deployment: Controlled & Isolated
Deployment operations live in **reusable GitHub Actions**, completely separate from development tasks:
- 🧱 `Clear separation` — developers focus on code, platform handles deployment  
- 🔐 `Secure by design` — production access restricted to approved CI events
- 🔁 `Reusable workflows` — standardized deployment patterns across projects

### Business Benefits
- 💰 `Reduced maintenance cost` — no more “works on my machine” syndrome
- 🚀 `Faster delivery` — fewer environment-specific bugs
- 🔐 `Stronger security` — containerized, read-only, non-root execution
- 📋 `Clear audit trails` — Git history = deployment history
- 🧠 `Better onboarding` — new engineers only need Docker and `task`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 🐳 `Docker` — all tasks run in containers
- 📋 `Task` — install from [taskfile.dev](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
- 🐙 `Git` — for version control and workflow triggers

### Step 1: Structure Your Project
Create the foundation for Taskfile-centric development:
```bash
your-project/
├── Taskfile.yml          # Your development tasks
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml        # CI using your tasks
└── src/                  # Your application code
```

### Step 2: Create Secure Container Runtime
Establish the foundation for containerized task execution with our proven security pattern:
```yaml
# Taskfile.yml - Internal task for secure container runtime
_docker/run:
  internal: true
  cmd: |
    docker run --rm --init {{if .TTY}}-it{{end}} \
      --cap-drop=ALL \
      --security-opt no-new-privileges \
      --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
      --workdir /workspace \
      --volume "{{.git_root}}/{{.MOUNT_DIR}}:/workspace:rw" \
      {{if .ENVS}}{{range $env := .ENVS}}--env {{$env}} {{end}}{{end}} \
      {{if .PORTS}}{{range $port := .PORTS}}--publish {{$port}} {{end}}{{end}} \
      {{.IMAGE}} \
      {{.CMD}}
  requires:
    vars: [IMAGE, CMD, MOUNT_DIR]
```

Example usage patterns:
```yaml
lint:
  desc: "Run code linting"
  cmds:
    - task: _docker/run
      vars:
        IMAGE: "node:20"
        CMD: "sh -c 'npm ci && npx eslint .'"
        MOUNT_DIR: "."
        ENVS:
          - "NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/workspace/.cache"
          - "NPM_CONFIG_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=false"

test:
  desc: "Run test suite"
  cmds:
    - task: _docker/run
      vars:
        IMAGE: "golang:1.21"
        CMD: "go test ./..."
        MOUNT_DIR: "."

run_dev:
    desc: Run dev on {{ .dev_port }}.
    cmds: 
      - task: _docker/run 
        vars: 
          IMAGE: "node:{{.node_version}}"
          CMD: "sh -c 'npm ci && npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port {{ .dev_port }}'"
          MOUNT_DIR: "site"
          PORTS:
            - "{{ .dev_port }}:{{ .dev_port }}"
          ENVS:
            - "NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/workspace/.cache"
            - "NPM_CONFIG_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=false"
          TTY: "true" # Interactive mode for dev servers
...
```

### Step 3: Design Your Task Structure
Build tasks around developer-facing operations that need local execution and debugging:  
| ✅ Include in Taskfile examples             | ❌ Keep out of Taskfile examples      |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| lint for code quality checks                | deployment operations                 |
| code formatting                             | infrastructure management             |
| unit and integration tests                  | production secrets handling           |
| compilation and bundling                    | cloud resource provisioning           |
| local development server                    |                                       |
| static analysis                             |                                       |

### Step 4: Connect to CI
Use our [taskfile-runner](https://github.com/Mad-Pixels/github-workflows/blob/main/.github/actions/taskfile-runner/action.yml) action to execute the same tasks in GitHub Actions:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run linting
        uses: Mad-Pixels/github-workflows/.github/actions/taskfile-runner@main
        with:
          command: "lint"
          
      - name: Run tests  
        uses: Mad-Pixels/github-workflows/.github/actions/taskfile-runner@main
        with:
          command: "test"

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build
        uses: Mad-Pixels/github-workflows/.github/actions/taskfile-runner@main
        with:
          command: "build"

    # CD part which not implement in Taskfile
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      ... your deploy process ...
```

## Real-World Examples
To make adoption as smooth as possible, we’ve prepared several opinionated example projects under [examples/](https://github.com/Mad-Pixels/github-workflows/tree/main/examples).  
Each contains its own `Taskfile.yml` and CI workflow, and is fully runnable out of the box:

| Example                               | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [nodejs](./examples/nodejs)           | Minimal Node.js starter: lint, format, unit tests, build, and dev server all in Docker.                 |
